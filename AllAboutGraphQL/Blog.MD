# Ask Me About GraphQL 

I love talking about GraphQL and listening to companies adopting or thinking of adopting GraphQL. I often get asked why would someone chose to move to GraphQL. There are a ton of resources out there that talk about the difference between REST and GraphQL and those are great to checkout if you are interested in how those two are different. In this blog post, I want to answer some common questions I get asked or questions you might have before starting GraphQL



## How has working with GraphQL on the Front End helped you?

As a Front End Engineer, I like working with a GraphQL API because -

1. Instantly test queries and mutations using GraphiQL or playground. 
2. Less data = lighter state management. 
3. Offload heavy lifting to the server through resolvers. 
4. Instant documentation.


## How is it better than REST? 
1. One endpoint to fetch all resources. 
2. Avoid overfetching of data (getting too many fields when only a few fields are needed).
3. Avoid underfetching of data  (having to call multiple APIs because one API doesn't give back all the information needed).



## I get that it will be useful for mobile applications where getting the payload size small is important, but how is it useful on the web?


## Our services are written in REST. It will take months to move them over to GraphQL 

## Isn't GraphQL helpful when you are writing close to the database? 

## I get that with GraphQL, you need to wait for the backend engineers to write the GraphQL API?

## Is it a query language for database? 

## Can GraphQL be used without JS? 

## Okay, cool. Where should I start?
